Set up the skeleton of the html page, making sure you have all the links
to bootstrap, font awesome and your own style sheet

--Perform the initial commit--

index: set up row and cols in the header - generally applying the law of 2/3

Style: add google fonts to style.css -- make sure that all the links are working before continuing

index: in bootstrap each row must follow a column class -- row >> col

index: start from the left -- or logo (for a profile)
style: add logo to css

index: ui-menu-color-home --was added as a class to target the nav elements individually for css

index: adding no-gutters --- gets rid of default padding provided by bootstrap---

style: added hover class and figured out how to make all the nav items change color or go as one colour
